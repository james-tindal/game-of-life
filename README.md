# Conway's Game of Life

In the 'simple' folder, there is a mostly fully working version.
To run, open simple/index.html in a browser

I am building a more complex one by imitating the cycle.js framework, using my own implementation of reactive streams and virtual DOM.
To run, 'npm run dev', go to http://localhost:3000
